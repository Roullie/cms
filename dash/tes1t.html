<p>Here's the short explanation for you: <strong>InStream video ads are ads that are added directly to the stream of the video. These ads play before Preroll, during Midroll, or after Postroll the video stream. Many different networks allow one or more versions of these InStream video ads, including YouTube and Facebook. The largest inventory of InStream video ad placements is on YouTube.</strong></p>
<h2>Why are they called InStream Ads</h2>
<p>So, you've heard of InStream ads and you're curious what they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>InStream video ads are just a video ad that is attached to the main video stream that the viewer is watching, hence the term instream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very common to also find the spelling instream video ads as well, so don't be confused by the hyphen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, you might be wondering what other types of video ads are available, to contrast with this InStream ad type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to InStream video ads, there are also Inbanner ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are banners that often appear in the sidebar and have a video embedded in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when some people refer to video ads, they are actually referring to text or image ads that are placed on or beside video. For example, you can have a YouTube Overlay Ad that is placed in the lower of a video being watched. That is an image ad on a video...which is why some people will say they saw a video ad. That's not what we're referring to, since that ad is not added to the video stream, but just an overlay of code on top of the video.</p>
<h2>What kind of InStream Ads are available</h2>
<p>Ok, now that you understand exactly what we are referring to when we say InStream video ads, let's take a minute to talk about the different types of these ads that are available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if you think about it for a second, there are really only 3 places that a video ad can be attached to a video stream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can have it attached at the beginning, the middle or sometime after the video has started, or at the very end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the video ad is attached to the video stream at the very beginning, this is called this a Preroll video ad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the video ad is attached to the video stream sometime after the video has started, but before the end of the video, this is called a Midroll video ad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the video ad is attached at the very end of the video stream, this is called a Postroll video ad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, think for a moment how each of these ads will be perceived by the viewing audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preroll video ads</strong> are going to interrupt the viewer between videos being viewed, or after the initial click. They haven't yet watched the content of the video, so the video ad comes ahead of whatever content they intended to watch. These can be excellent InStream ads when you carefully select managed placements that are highly relevant to the content of your video ad. They can be seen as annoying if they are completely irrelevant and just a speed bump in the viewing experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Midroll video ads</strong> are very similar to TV commercials. The viewer is already watching the video content and then is stopped and forced to watch some or all of a video ad to continue. Midroll ads have good watch times, but can be challenging to get the viewer to act on the call to action if it involves leaving the video site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Postroll video ads</strong> are going to affect the viewers the least, because they've already finished watching their video, and they are not interrupted in any way</p>
